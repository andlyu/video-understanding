# Video Understanding
Repo for a bunch of video understanding related tasks and exploration

Feel free to checkout [Lavila for video QA](https://github.com/andlyu/LaViLa) (fork of LaViLa). There Captions were generated based on a video (using Lavila Narrirator), then ChatGPT answered question based on the generated captions. 
These are 5 choice MC questions and resulted in an accuracy of .42, compared with previous SOTA of .32, and random guessing of .2. All later submissions on the Ego-schema dataset are between .45 and .51.
